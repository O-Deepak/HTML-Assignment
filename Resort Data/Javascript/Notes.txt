Javascript is a scripting language used to create dynamic content within HTML documents.
HTML is static markup language, so any changes or dynamic content U wish to place cannot be set unless U reload the page. 
To make dynamic content, we need a thin programming content which is light weight and powerfull. This is done thro Scripting languages. JS is the most popular Scripting language. It is recommended by w3c. All browsers by default support JS. JS itself is maintained by a group of companies called ECMA(European Computer Manifactureres Association), The Current std of JS is ECMAScript 9. (ES9). 
All browsers are expected to apply the ES Stds in their browsers so that the code that is developed should adhere to the coding principles of ECMA. All latest browsers support upto ES8.
